# Game Jam 12/2021

A collaborative game project worked on by Blake, Max (the good one), sambo, and sisbo/mini-slam.

We used Unity 2020.3.22f1 for the game, and Jetbrains Rider for the scripting.

# The Concept

Our goal was to create a game similar to Overcooked or Plate!Up, where the focus is on feeding customers in order to satisfy them. However, the twist is that the customers are a variety of monsters. They will appear throughout each round, with each round having a set number of customers that must be fed to progress.

The customers will enter the restaurant and immediately walk to the kitchen area, where they will attempt to steal food and cooking equipment. The player can "bonk" a customer to get them to seat themselves at an available table. If the customer was stealing an item at the time, they will drop the item. Once seated, the customer must be fed in a certain amount of time or they will try to steal again.

While stealing, the customer will pick up the items and attempt to exit the restaurant. The player cannot recover any stolen equipment until the round is over.

The player must balance defending their kitchen and feeding the customers. To feed the customers, the player can use equipment such as frying pans to prepare the food. Once prepared, the player can pick up the food and deliver it to a seated customer's table. Fed customers will then exit the restaurant.

Along with "normal" customers, harder "boss" customers can also appear, which require more food to satisfy.
